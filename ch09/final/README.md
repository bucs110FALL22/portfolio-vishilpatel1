# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION: This coding project was a little different but I wanted to try something more advanced and interestesting so I created a code that can upload videos to tiktok!!

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS: None but you may have to utilize vscode in order to run this code since it is more complex and replit can't process at certain times

## REFERENCES: I utilized my previously known CS skills and newly learned material

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS: This is a cool coding project I was working on already and I'm still working on it everyday in order to do new things with it and make it better. In order to run this code you have to paste the path of your downloaded video into line 111 where it says "path" In addtion, this code will work with the utilization of cookie, when you open your tik tok it will be stored as a cookie (if this code doesn't run on your personal replit utilize vscode since replit has trouble with path sometimes)
